# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

Our client MegaTel, a leading telecommunications company, is facing a growing issue with customer churn. Their current method with this problem is reactive which only reach out to customer after they've already canceled their service. Unfortunately this approach isn't working well since they couldn't prevent customer from leave them.

Furthermore, their attempts at analyzing customer data using Excel haven't been very helpful, and it's hard for management to grasp the insights they need from these analysis.
